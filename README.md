# Instructions and Setup Guide

## Containerize the application using Docker

1. Build the Docker Image
  
```bash
$ docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t news-classifier .
```

2. Start the container:

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 news-classifier
```

3. Test the Docker container with an example request:

- Option 1: Using the web browser. 

  Visit `http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs`. You will see a /predict endpoint: 

![](https://corise-mlops.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/project3/pic2.png)

You can click on "Try it now" which will let you modify the input request. Click on "Execute" to see the model prediction response from the web server:

  - Option 2: Using the command line:

```bash

$ curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://0.0.0.0/predict' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "source": "<value>",
  "url": "<value>",
  "title": "<value>",
  "description": "<value>"
}'

```

## Local testing & examining logs

1. Find out the container id of the running container:
```bash
$ docker ps
```

This will return a response like the following:
```bash

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                NAMES
3a45c7f7661c   news-classifier-w3   "uvicorn server:app â€¦"   4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   happy_burnell
```

2. SSH into the container using the container id from above: 

```bash
$ docker exec -it <container id> /bin/sh
```

3. Tail the logs:
```bash

$ tail -f ../data/logs.out
```

4. Now when you send any request to the web server (from the browser, or another tab in the command line), you can see the log output coming through in `logs.out`. Test the web server with these requests and make sure you can see the outputs in `logs.out`:
